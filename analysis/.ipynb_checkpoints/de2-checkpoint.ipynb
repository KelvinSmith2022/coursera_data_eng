      " 'Computer science legend Donald Knuth once said “I don’t understand things unless I try to program them.” We also believe that the best way to learn an algorithm is to program it. However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner) and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice.\\xa0To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview.

Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime?

But who are the miners? How did they get into this? How do they operate? What\\'s the business model like for miners? What impact do they have on the environment? ~.~ Bitcoin and Anonymity ~.~ Is Bitcoin anonymous? What does that statement even mean—can we define it rigorously? We\\'ll learn about the various ways to improve Bitcoin\\'s anonymity and privacy and learn about Bitcoin\\'s role in Silk Road and other hidden marketplaces. ~.~ Community, Politics, and Regulation ~.~ We\\'ll look at all the ways that the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technology touches the world of people. We\\'ll discuss the community, politics within Bitcoin and the way that Bitcoin interacts with politics, and law enforcement and regulation issues. ~.~ Alternative Mining Puzzles ~.~ Not everyone is happy about how Bitcoin mining works: its energy consumption and the fact that it requires specialized hardware are major sticking points. This week we\\'ll look at how mining can be re-designed in alternative cryptocurrencies. ~.~ Bitcoin as a Platform ~.~ One of the most exciting things about Bitcoin technology is its potential to support applications other than currency.

      " 'First-Order Differential Equations ~.~ A differential equation is an equation for a function with one or more of its derivatives.   We introduce differential equations and classify them.  We then learn about the Euler method for numerically solving a first-order ordinary differential equation (ode).  Then we learn analytical methods for solving separable and linear first-order odes.  An explanation of the theory is followed by illustrative solutions of some simple odes.  Finally, we learn about three real-world examples of first-order odes:  compound interest, terminal velocity of a falling mass, and the resistor-capacitor electrical circuit. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Homogeneous Linear Differential Equations ~.~ We generalize  the Euler numerical method to a second-order ode.   We then develop two theoretical concepts used for linear equations:  the principle of superposition, and the Wronskian.  Armed with these concepts, we can find analytical solutions to a homogeneous second-order ode with constant coefficients.  We make use of  an exponential ansatz, and transform the constant-coefficient ode to a quadratic equation called the characteristic equation of the ode.  The characteristic equation may have real or complex roots and we learn solution methods for the different cases. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Inhomogeneous Linear Differential Equations ~.~ We now add an inhomogeneous term to the constant-coefficient ode.  The inhomogeneous term may be an exponential, a sine or cosine, or a polynomial.   We also study the phenomena of resonance, when the forcing frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the oscillator.  Finally, we learn about three important applications: the RLC electrical circuit, a mass on a spring, and the pendulum. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ The Laplace Transform and Series Solution Methods ~.~ We present  two new analytical solution methods for solving linear odes.  The first is the Laplace transform method, which is used to solve the constant-coefficient ode with a discontinuous or impulsive inhomogeneous term.  The Laplace transform is a good vehicle in general for  introducing sophisticated integral transform techniques within an easily understandable context.     We also discuss the series solution of a linear ode.  Although we do not go deeply here, an introduction to this technique may be useful to students that encounter it again in more advanced  courses. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Systems of Differential Equations ~.~ We learn how to solve a coupled system of homogeneous  first-order differential equations with constant coefficients.  This system of odes can be written in matrix form, and we learn how to convert these equations into  a standard matrix algebra eigenvalue problem.  The two-dimensional solutions are visualized using phase portraits.  We then learn about the important application of coupled harmonic oscillators and the calculation of normal modes.  The normal modes are those motions for which the individual masses that make up the system oscillate with the same frequency. ~.~ Partial Differential Equations ~.~ To learn how to solve a partial differential equation (pde), we first define a Fourier series. We then derive the one-dimensional diffusion equation, which is a pde for the diffusion of a dye in a pipe.  We proceed to solve this pde using the method of separation of variables.'\n",
      " 'MATRICES ~.~ Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers or other mathematical objects.  We define matrices and how to add and multiply them, discuss some special matrices such as the identity and zero matrix, learn about transposes and inverses, and define orthogonal and permutation matrices. ~.~ SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS ~.~ A system of linear equations can be written in matrix form, and can be solved  using Gaussian elimination.  We learn how to bring a matrix to reduced row echelon form, and how this can be used to compute a matrix inverse.  We learn how to find the LU decomposition of a matrix, and how to use this decomposition to efficiently solve a system of linear equations with evolving right-hand sides. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ VECTOR SPACES ~.~ A vector space consists of a set of vectors and a set of scalars that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication and that satisfies the usual rules of arithmetic.  We  learn some of the vocabulary and phrases of linear algebra, such as linear independence, span, basis and dimension.  We  learn about the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix, the Gram-Schmidt process, orthogonal projection, and the matrix formulation of the least-squares problem of drawing a straight line to fit noisy data. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS ~.~ An eigenvector of a matrix is a nonzero column vector that when multiplied by the matrix is only multiplied by a scalar, called the eigenvalue.  We learn about the eigenvalue problem and how to use determinants to find the eigenvalues of a matrix.  We learn how to compute determinants using the Laplace expansion, the Leibniz formula, or by row or column elimination.   We also learn how to diagonalize a matrix using its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how this leads to an easy calculation of a matrix raised to a power. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL'\n",

You will learn what a Taylor series is and how to compute it. Don\\'t worry! The notation may be unfamiliar, but it\\'s all just working with polynomials.... ~.~ Limits and Asymptotics ~.~ A Taylor series may or may not converge, depending on its limiting (or \"asymptotic\") properties. Indeed, Taylor series are a perfect tool for understanding limits, both large and small, making sense of such methods as that of l\\'Hopital.  To solidify these newfound skills, we introduce the language of \"big-O\" as a means of bounding the size of asymptotic terms.  This language will be put to use in future Chapters on Calculus. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL'\n",
      " \"Vectors ~.~ A vector is a mathematical construct that has both length and direction.  We will define vectors and learn how to add and subtract them, and how to multiply them using the scalar and vector products (dot and cross products).  We will use vectors to learn some analytical geometry of lines and planes, and learn about the Kronecker delta and the Levi-Civita symbol to prove vector identities.  The important concepts of scalar and vector fields will be introduced. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Differentiation ~.~ Scalar and vector fields can be differentiated.  We define the partial derivative and derive the method of least squares as a minimization problem.  We learn how to use the chain rule for a function of several variables, and derive the triple product rule used in chemical engineering.  We define the gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian.  We learn some useful vector calculus identities and how to derive them using the Kronecker delta and Levi-Civita symbol.  Vector identities are then used to derive the electromagnetic wave equation from Maxwell's equation in free space.  Electromagnetic waves form the basis of all modern communication technologies. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Integration and Curvilinear Coordinates ~.~ Integration can be extended to functions of several variables.  We learn how to perform double and triple integrals.  Curvilinear coordinates, namely polar coordinates in two dimensions, and cylindrical and spherical coordinates in three dimensions, are used to simplify problems with circular, cylindrical or spherical symmetry.  We learn how to write differential operators in curvilinear coordinates and how to change variables in multidimensional integrals using the Jacobian of the transformation. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Line and Surface Integrals ~.~ Scalar or vector fields can be integrated on curves or surfaces.  We learn how to take the line integral of a scalar field and  use line integrals to compute arc lengths.  We then learn how to take line integrals of vector fields by taking the dot product of the vector field with tangent unit vectors to the curve.  Consideration of the line integral of a force field results in the work-energy theorem.  Next, we learn how to take the surface integral of a scalar field and compute surface areas.  We then learn how to take the surface integral of a vector field by taking the dot product of the vector field with the normal unit vector to the surface.  The surface integral of a velocity field is used to define the mass flux of a fluid through the surface. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Fundamental Theorems ~.~ The fundamental theorem of calculus links integration with differentiation.  Here, we learn the related fundamental theorems of vector calculus.  These include the gradient theorem, the divergence theorem, and Stokes' theorem.  We show how these theorems are used to derive continuity equations, derive the law of conservation of energy, define the divergence and curl in coordinate-free form, and convert the integral version of Maxwell's equations into their more aesthetically pleasing differential form.\"\n",
      " \"Fibonacci:  It's as easy as 1, 1, 2, 3 ~.~ We  learn about the Fibonacci numbers, the golden ratio, and their relationship.  We derive the celebrated Binet's formula, an explicit formula for the Fibonacci numbers in terms of  powers of the golden ratio and its reciprical. ~.~ Identities, sums and rectangles ~.~ We  learn about the Fibonacci Q-matrix and Cassini's identity.  Cassini's identity is the basis for a famous dissection fallacy colourfully named  the Fibonacci bamboozlement.  A dissection fallacy is an apparent paradox arising from two arrangements of different area from one set of puzzle pieces.      We also derive formulas for the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers, and the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers squared.  Finally, we show how to construct a golden rectangle, and how this leads to the beautiful image of spiralling squares. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ The most irrational number ~.~ We   learn about the golden spiral and the Fibonacci spiral.  Because of the relationship between the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio, the Fibonacci spiral  eventually converges to the golden spiral.  You will recognise the Fibonacci spiral because it is the icon of our course.  We next learn about continued fractions.  To construct a continued fraction is to construct a sequence of rational numbers that converges to a target irrational number.  The golden ratio is the irrational number whose continued fraction converges the slowest.  We say that the golden ratio is the irrational number that is the most difficult to approximate by a rational number, or that  the golden ratio is the most irrational of the irrational numbers. We then define the golden angle, related to the golden ratio, and use it to model the growth of a sunflower head.  Use of the golden angle in the model  allows a fine packing of the florets, and results in the unexpected appearance of the Fibonacci numbers in the sunflower. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL\"\n",

      " 'Week 1 ~.~ START with the Welcome lecture. It explains what this course is about. (It comes with a short Background Reading assignment, to read before you start the course, and a Reading Supplement on Set Theory for use later in the course, both in downloadable PDF format.) This initial orientation lecture is important, since this course is probably not like any math course you have taken before – even if in places it might look like one!  AFTER THAT, Lecture 1 prepares the groundwork for the course; then in Lecture 2 we dive into the first topic. This may all look like easy stuff, but tens of thousands of former students found they had trouble later by skipping through Week 1 too quickly! Be warned. If possible, form or join a study group and discuss everything with them. BY THE WAY, the time estimates for watching the video lectures are machine generated, based on the video length. Expect to spend a lot longer going through the lectures sufficiently well to understand the material. The time estimates for completing the weekly Problem Sets (Quiz format) are a bit more reliable, but even they are just a guideline. You may find yourself taking a lot longer. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 2 ~.~ In Week 2 we continue our discussion of formalized parts of language for use in mathematics. By now you should have familiarized yourself with the basic structure of the course: 1. Watch the first lecture and answer the in-lecture quizzes; tackle each of the problems in the associated Assignment sheet; THEN watch the tutorial video for the Assignment sheet. 2. REPEAT sequence for the second lecture. 3. THEN do the Problem Set, after which you can view the Problem Set tutorial. REMEMBER, the time estimates for watching the video lectures are machine generated, based on the video length. Expect to spend a lot longer going through the lectures sufficiently well to understand the material. The time estimates for completing the weekly Problem Sets (Quiz format) are a bit more reliable, but even they are just a guideline. You may find yourself taking a lot longer. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 3 ~.~ This week we continue our analysis of language for use in mathematics. Remember, while the parts of language we are focusing have particular importance in mathematics, our main interest is in the analytic process itself: How do we formalize concepts from everyday life? Because the topics become more challenging, starting this week we have just one basic lecture cycle (Lecture -> Assignment -> Tutorial ->  Problem Set -> Tutorial) each week. If you have not yet found one or more people to work with, please try to do so. It is so easy to misunderstand this material. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 4 ~.~ This week we complete our analysis of language, putting into place the linguistic apparatus that enabled, mathematicians in the 19th Century to develop a formal mathematical treatment of infinity, thereby finally putting Calculus onto a firm footing, three hundred years after its invention. (You do not need to know calculus for this course.) It is all about being precise and unambiguous. (But only where it counts. We are trying to extend our fruitfully-flexible human language and reasoning, not replace them with a rule-based straightjacket!) ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 5 ~.~ This week we take our first look at mathematical proofs, the bedrock of modern mathematics. ~.~ Week 6 ~.~ This week we complete our brief look at mathematical proofs ~.~ Week 7 ~.~ The topic this week is the branch of mathematics known as Number Theory. Number Theory, which goes back to the Ancient Greek mathematicians, is a hugely important subject within mathematics, having ramifications throughout mathematics, in physics, and in some of today\\'s most important technologies. In this course, however, we consider only some very elementary parts of the subject, using them primarily to illustrate mathematical thinking. ~.~ Week 8 ~.~ In this final week of instruction, we look at the beginnings of the important subject known as Real Analysis, where we closely examine the real number system and develop a rigorous foundation for calculus. This is where we really benefit from our earlier analysis of language. University math majors generally regard Real Analysis as extremely difficult, but most of the problems they encounter in the early days stem from not having made a prior study of language use, as we have here. ~.~ Weeks 9 & 10: Test Flight ~.~ Test Flight provides an opportunity to experience an important aspect of \"being a mathematician\": evaluating real mathematical arguments produced by others. There are three stages. It is important to do them in order, and to not miss any steps. STAGE 1: You complete the Test Flight Problem Set (available as a downloadable PDF with the introductory video), entering your solutions in the Peer Evaluation module. STAGE 2: You complete three Evaluation Exercises, where you evaluate solutions to the Problem Set specially designed to highlight different kinds of errors. The format is just like the weekly Problem Sets, with machine grading. You should view the Tutorial video for each Exercise after you submit your solutions, but BEFORE you start the next Exercise. STAGE 3: You evaluate three Problem Set solutions submitted by other students. (This process is anonymous.) This final stage takes place in the Peer Evaluation module. After you are done peer reviewing, you may want to evaluate your own solution. It can be very informative to see how you rate your own attempt after looking at the work of others.'\n",

One of the things you’ll almost certainly be asked to do during a technical phone interview is to code up a solution to a problem in a shared text document (e.g. Google doc) while you are on the phone with the interviewer.  This experience can be intimidating, unfamiliar and humbling if you are not prepared, so this week we will give you lots of practice and tips for getting through this part of the interview with flying colors. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Explaining what you've already done: Lesson Choices ~.~  ~.~ Algorithmic thinking on the fly ~.~ As we saw in week 2, coding on the fly can be a difficult task!  In this final week of the course we’ll revisit the skill of live problem solving by looking at how to solve more challenging algorithmic problems (and write the code associated with the solution) on the whiteboard.  You’ll recognize these problems as “classic” interview problems you’ve probably heard a lot about, designed to test your problem solving skills as well as your analysis and coding abilities.  Don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to approach them with confidence through a 6-step process to addressing technical questions (hint: you don’t have to produce the perfect solution on the first try!).  We’ll show you how to use this process in a number of examples.  But of course, there is no substitute for practice, so we’ll set you up with how to train and evaluate yourself. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL\"\n",

      " 'How Do We Know if We\\'re Building for a User that Doesn\\'t Exist? ~.~ How do you go from backlog grooming to blockbuster results with agile? Hypothesis-driven decisions. Specifically, you need to shift your teammates focus from their natural tendency to focus on their own output to focusing out user outcomes. Easier said than done, but getting everyone excited about results of an experiment is one of the most reliable ways to get there. This week, we’ll focus on how you get started in a practical way. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ How Do We Reduce Waste & Increase Wins by Testing Our Propositions Before We Build Them? ~.~ Nothing will help a team deliver better outcomes like making sure they’re building something the user values. This might sound simple or obvious, but I think after this week it’s likely you’ll find opportunities to help improve your team’s focus by testing ideas more definitively before you invest in developing software. In this module, you’ll learn how to make concept testing an integral part of your product pipeline. We’ll continue to apply methods from Lean Startup, looking at how they pair with agile. We’ll look at how high-functioning teams design and run situation-appropriate experiments to test ideas, and how that works before the fact (when you’re testing an idea) and after the fact (when you’re testing the value of software you’ve released). ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ How Do We Consistently Deliver Great Usability? ~.~ The best products are tested for usability early and often, avoiding the destructive stress and uncertainty of a \"big unveil.\" In this module, you’ll learn how to diagnose, design and execute phase-appropriate user testing. The tools you’ll learn to use here (a test plan template, prototyping tool, and test session infrastructure) are accessible/teachable to anyone on your team. And that’s a very good thing -- often products are released with poor usability because there \"wasn’t enough time\" to test it. With these techniques, you’ll be able to test early and often, reinforcing your culture of experimentation. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ How Do We Invest to Move Fast? ~.~ You’ve learned how to test ideas and usability to reduce the amount of software your team needs to build and to focus its execution. Now you’re going to learn how high-functioning teams approach testing of the software itself. The practice of continuous delivery and the closely related Devops movement are changing the way we build and release software. It wasn’t that long ago where 2-3 releases a year was considered standard. Now, Amazon, for example, releases code every 11.6 seconds.

      " 'Introduction ~.~ We perform experiments all the time, so let\\'s learn some terminology that we will use throughout the course. We show plenty of examples, and see how to analyze an experiment. We end by pointing out: \"how not to run an experiment\". ~.~ Analysis of experiments by hand ~.~ The focus is on manual calculations. Why? Because you have to understand the most basic building blocks of efficient experiments. We look at systems with 2 and 3 variables (factors). Don\\'t worry; the computer will do the work in the next module. ~.~ Using computer software to analyze experiments ~.~ Now we use free software to do the work for us. You can even run the software through a website (without installing anything special). We look at systems with 2, 3 and 4 factors. Most importantly we focus on the software interpretation. ~.~ Getting more information, with fewer experiments ~.~ This is where the course gets tough and rough, but real. The quiz at the end if a tough one, so take it several times to be sure you have mastered the material - that\\'s all that matters - understanding. We want to do as few experiments as possible, while still learning the most we can. Feel free to skip to module 5, which is the crucial learning from the whole course. You can come back here later. In module 4 we show how to do *practical* experiments that practitioners use everyday. We learn about important safeguards to ensure that we are not mislead by Mother Nature. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Response surface methods (RSM) to optimize any system ~.~ This is the goal we\\'ve been working towards: how to optimize any system. We start gently. We optimize a system with 1 factor and we also show why optimizing one factor at a time is misleading. We spend several videos to show how to optimize a system with 2 variables. ~.~ Wrap-up and future directions ~.~ We close up the course and point out the next steps you might follow to extend what you have learned here.'\n",

      " \"WEEK 1 - Research and its context ~.~ Week 1 has an introductory and motivational purpose. It faces the following questions: What is science? What is scientific research? What is the relation between scientific progress and the progress of society? What is the relation between research and innovation? Why should researchers engage themselves publicly? ~.~ WEEK 2 - Research Methodology ~.~ Week 2 focuses on research methods. It discusses the interplay between invention — the creative act that identifies an interesting open problem and a possible solution — and validation — the meticulous process through which the identified solution is critically evaluated. It briefly discusses the historical evolution of the notion of a “scientific method”, through which research results are validated, mainly developed in the context of physical and natural sciences. Then it broadens the analysis to other kinds of research, and in particular ICST research. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ WEEK 3 - The products of research: publications and beyond ~.~ The results of research (its products) are used to develop further research and lead to industrial innovations and societal changes. Week 3 focuses on the diffusion process of research products. The main way of diffusing research results is through scientific publications. The traditional publication process is analysed and recent trends towards open access are also discussed. Other kinds of research products, which take the form of artifacts, like data sets or research prototypes, are also discussed. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ WEEK 4 - The researcher's progress ~.~ Week 4 focuses on the researcher’s career progress in his/her professional life, from being a researcher-in-formation to becoming a junior independent researcher to maturing into an established research leader. In particular, it discusses the skills one needs to acquire and provides tips of advice on how to progress successfully. ~.~ WEEK 5 - Evaluating research ~.~ Week 5 focuses on evaluation in research. Evaluation is key to research, as for any intrinsically competitive human endeavor. Researchers are evaluated for hiring, funding, and promotion. Research units (groups, departments) are also evaluated for funding. Even global institutions (like universities) are evaluated and ranked internationally. Traditionally, evaluation is performed via peer review. Increasingly, other forms of evaluation based on quantitative indicators — such as bibliometric indicators — have been emerging and are increasingly used. Quantitative indicators are discussed and critically analyzed. ~.~ WEEK 6 - Research ethics ~.~ Week 6 focuses on the ethical issues involved in doing research. It defines the notions of ethics and misconduct. It discusses misconduct in proposing, performing, reviewing research or reporting research, focusing in particular on plagiarism, breach of confidentiality, conflict of interest. Possible ethical aspects involved in the specific research are also discussed. Research can involve or affects humans, other organisms, or the environment. This is traditionally well understood, e.g. in life sciences. Increasingly research in all areas of technology is getting closer to humans and touches ethical sensitive issues.\"\n",
      " 'The responsibility of engineers ~.~ This module discusses the responsibility of engineers. We will investigate what exactly responsibility is, distinguishing between passive responsibility for things that happened in the past and active responsibility for things not yet attained.  Furthermore, we will discuss the professional responsibility of engineers, examine the consequences for this responsibility, such as whistle-blowing and the application of the precautionary principle. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Codes of conduct ~.~ In this module, we discuss the role of codes of conduct in engineering. In particular, we focus on professional codes as they have been proposed by professional engineering societies and on corporate codes, as they have been formulated by companies. We discuss these two types of codes, their structure and their content, and a number of common objections that have been levelled against codes of conduct. This includes the problem that someone is acting according to the code, but that it may nevertheless lead to dismissal. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Normative ethics ~.~ In this module we will discuss some ethical theories that have been developed by various philosophers. Ethical theories help us to sort out our thinking and to develop a coherent and justifiable basis for dealing with moral questions. The role of ethical theories is to provide certain arguments or reasons for a moral judgment. They provide a normative framework for understanding and responding to moral problems, so improving ethical decision-making or, at least, avoiding certain shortcuts, such as neglecting certain relevant features of the problem or just stating an opinion without any justification. In this module we shall therefore introduce three of the most well-known ethical theories: consequentialism, duty ethics and virtue ethics. These theories each have their own criteria with which they determine whether an action is right or wrong. Before we go into these three theories we shall discuss what we mean by morality and ethics, and we shall look into the points of departure of ethics: values, norms, and virtues. These points of departure often recur in ethical theories. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ The ethical cycle ~.~ Engineers will encounter in their professional life some difficult moral situations. Such situations call for moral judgment, using the tools we have introduced in the preceding modules. However, moral judgment is not a straightforward or linear process in which you simply apply ethical theories to find out what to do. Instead it is a process in which the formulation of the moral problem, the formulation of possible ‘solutions’, and the ethical judging of these solutions go hand in hand. This messy character of moral problems, however, does not rule out a systematic approach. In this module we describe a systematic approach to problem solving that does justice to the complex nature of moral problems and moral judgment: the ethical cycle. Our goal is to provide a structured method of addressing moral problems which helps to guide a sound analysis of these problems. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Ethical questions in the design of technology ~.~ Disasters like the Challenger illustrates the importance of design to engineering. In this case, as in other cases, the design phase was crucial for the proper working of a technology and possible risks and other side effects. The example also shows the importance of activities that are closely related to design like testing, certification and inspection. Second, the example shows that most design involves trade-offs. In wheel design for trains, e.g., a trade-off is faced between energy (and cost) efficiency and comfort. We start with a description of what designing is and what type of ethical issues may arise in the various stages of the design process. Next, we shall take a closer look at one aspect of the design: the choice between different conceptual designs in the light of design requirements and trade-offs. ~.~ Designing morality ~.~ Technological artefacts can be politically or morally charged. This means that ethics is not just a matter of people but also of things. To better understand, the moral role of technological artefacts, we will elaborate this notion of ‘technological mediation’. After this, the implications of this mediation approach for ethics will be investigated, especially to what extent we can moralize technology. ~.~ Ethical aspects of technological risks ~.~ To a certain extent hazards are inherent to technology. In this module, we shall discuss the moral issues that are raised by the risks and hazards of technologies, and how engineers can deal with those issues. We will discuss the current methods for assessing risks, and the moral acceptability of technological risks. ~.~ Distribution of responsibility ~.~ It is often very difficult to pinpoint responsibility and blame in cases in which many people are involved in an activity and in which many causes contributed to a disaster. Dealing with the problem of many hands requires attention for the distribution of responsibility in engineering. In this module we will discuss how responsibilities are actually distributed in engineering, and how the resulting responsibility distribution can be evaluated in terms of moral fairness (are the appropriate persons held responsible?) and in terms of effectiveness (does the responsibility distribution contribute to avoiding harm and in achieving beneficial results?) ~.~ Exam ~.~ '\n",
      " 'Week 01 - Discrete World, Wave Physics, Computers ~.~ The use of numerical methods to solve partial differential equations is motivated giving examples form Earth sciences. Concepts of discretization in space and time are introduced and the necessity to sample fields with sufficient accuracy is motivated (i.e. number of grid points per wavelength). Computational meshes are discussed and their power and restrictions to model complex geometries illustrated. The basics of parallel computers and parallel programming are discussed and their impact on realistic simulations. The specific partial differential equation used in this course to illustrate various numerical methods is presented: the acoustic wave equation. Some physical aspects of this equation are illustrated that are relevant to understand its solutions. Finally Jupyter notebooks are introduced that are used with Python programs to illustrate the implementation of the numerical methods. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 02 The Finite-Difference Method - Taylor Operators ~.~ In Week 2 we introduce the basic definitions of the finite-difference method. We learn how to use Taylor series to estimate the error of the finite-difference approximations to derivatives and how to increase the accuracy of the approximations using longer operators. We also learn how to implement numerical derivatives using Python. ~.~ Week 03 The Finite-Difference Method - 1D Wave Equation - von Neumann Analysis ~.~ We develop the finite-difference algorithm to the acoustic wave equation in 1D, discuss boundary conditions and how to initialize a simulation example. We look at solutions using the Python implementation and observe numerical artifacts. We analytically derive one of the most important results of numerical analysis – the CFL criterion which leads to a conditionally stable algorithm for explicit finite-difference schemes. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 04 The Finite-Difference Method in 2D - Numerical Anisotropy, Heterogeneous Media ~.~ We develop the solution to the 2D acoustic wave equation, compare with analytical solutions and demonstrate the phenomenon of numerical (non-physical) anisotropy. We extend the von Neumann Analysis to 2D and derive numerical anisotropy analytically. We learn how to initialize a realistic physical problem and illustrate that 2D solution are already quite powerful to understand complex wave phenomena. We introduced the 1D elastic wave equation and show the concept of staggered-grid schemes with the coupled first-order velocity-stress formulation. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 05 The Pseudospectral Method, Function Interpolation ~.~ We start with the problem of function interpolation leading to the concept of Fourier series. We move to the discrete Fourier series and highlight their exact interpolation properties on regular spatial grids. We introduce the derivative of functions using discrete Fourier transforms and use it to solve the 1D and 2D acoustic wave equation. The necessity to simulate waves in limited areas leads us to the definition of Chebyshev polynomials and their uses as basis functions for function interpolation. We develop the concept of differentiation matrices and discuss a solution scheme for the elastic wave equation using Chebyshev polynomials. ~.~ Week 06 The Linear Finite-Element Method - Static Elasticity ~.~ We introduce the concept of finite elements and develop the weak form of the wave equation. We discuss the Galerkin principle and derive a finite-element algorithm for the static elasticity problem based upon linear basis functions.  We also discuss how to implement boundary conditions. The finite-difference based relaxation method is derived for the same equation and the solution compared to the finite-element algorithm. ~.~ Week 07 The Linear Finite-Element Method - Dynamic Elasticity ~.~ We extend the finite-element solution to the elastic wave equation and compare the solution scheme to the finite-difference method. To allow direct comparison we formulate the finite-difference solution in matrix-vector form and demonstrate the similarity of the linear finite-element method and the finite-difference approach. We introduce the concept of h-adaptivity, the space-dependence of the element size for heterogeneous media. ~.~ Week 08 The Spectral-Element Method - Lagrange Interpolation, Numerical Integration ~.~ We introduce the fundamentals of the spectral-element method developing a solution scheme for the 1D elastic wave equation. Lagrange polynomials are discussed as the basis functions of choice. The concept of Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre numerical integration is introduced and shown that it leads to a diagonal mass matrix making its inversion trivial. ~.~ Week 09 The Spectral Element Method - 1D Elastic Wave Equation, Convergence Test ~.~ We finalize the derivation of the spectral-element solution to the elastic wave equation. We show how to calculate the required derivatives of the Lagrange polynomials making use of Legendre polynomials. We show how to perform the assembly step leading to the final solution system for the elastic wave equation. We demonstrate the numerical solution for homogenous and heterogeneous media.'\n",
      " 'Introduction and general concepts ~.~ This module gives an overview of the course and presents the general ideas about modeling and simulation. An emphasis is given on ways to represent space and time from a conceptual point of view. An insight of modeling of complex systems is given with the simulation of the grothw and thrombosis of giant aneurysms. Finally, a first class of modeling approaches is presented: the Monte-Carlo methods. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Introduction to programming with Python 3 ~.~ This module intends to provide the most basic concepts of high performance computing used for modeling purposes. It also aims at teaching the basics of Python 3 which will be the programming language used for the quizzes in this course. ~.~ Dynamical systems and numerical integration ~.~ Dynamical systems modeling is the principal method developed to study time-space dependent problems. It aims at translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical set of equations. Once this basic step is performed the principal obstacle is the actual resolution of the obtained mathematical problem. Usually these equations do not possess an analytical solution and advanced numerical methods must be applied to solve them. In this module you will learn the basics of how to write mathematical equations representing natural phenomena and then how to numerically solve them. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Cellular Automata ~.~ This module defines the concept of cellular automata by outlining the basic building blocks of this method. Then an insight of how to apply this technique to natural phenomena is given. Finally the lattice gas automata, a subclass of models used for fluid flows, is presented. ~.~ Lattice Boltzmann modeling of fluid flow ~.~ This module provides an introduction to the lattice Boltzmann method, a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics. The lesson is practice oriented and show, step by step, how to write a program for the lattice Boltzmann method. The program is used to showcase an interesting problem in fluid dynamics, the simulation of a vortex street behind an obstacle. ~.~ Particles and point-like objects ~.~ A short review of classical mechanics, and of numerical methods used to integrate the equations of motions for many interacting particles is presented. The student will learn that the computational expense of resolving all interaction between particles poses a major obstacle to simulating such a system. Specific algorithms are presented to allow to cut down on computational expense, both for short-range and large-range forces. The module focuses in detail on the Barnes-Hut algorithm, a tree algorithm which is popular a popular approach to solve the N-Body problem. ~.~ Introduction to Discrete Events Simulation ~.~ In this module, we will see an alternative approach to model systems which display a trivial behaviour most of the time, but which may change significantly under a sequence of discrete events. Initially developed to simulate queue theory systems (such as consumer waiting queue), the Discrete Event approach has been apply to a large variety of problems, such as traffic intersection modeling or volcanic hazard predictions. ~.~ Agent based models ~.~ Agent Based Models (ABM) are used to model a complex system by decomposing it in small entities (agents) and by focusing on the relations between agents and with the environment. This approach is derived from artificial intelligence research and is currently used to model various systems such as pedestrian behaviour, social insects, biological cells, etc.'\n",
      " \"Origins of the scientific method ~.~ Science is all about gaining knowledge, coming up with the best possible explanations of the world around us. So how do we decide which explanation is the best one? How do we make sure our explanations are accurate? ~.~ How do we determine we actually know something? In science we try to resolve these questions by using a set of principles and procedures called the scientific method. You need to know its historical and philosophical  'origin story' to really understand the scientific method and to fully appreciate how hard it is to apply the scientific method in the social and behavioral sciences! ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ The Scientific Method ~.~ In the first module we discussed how the scientific method developed, general philosophical approaches and the types of knowledge science aims to find. In this second module we'll make these abstract principles and concepts a little more concrete by discussing the empirical cycle and causality in more detail. We’ll see how, and in what order these concepts are implemented when we conduct a research study. We'll also consider the main criteria for evaluating the methodological quality of a research study: Validity and reliability. The focus will be on internal validity and how internal validity can be threatened. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Research Designs ~.~ In the previous module we discussed the empirical cycle, causality and the criteria for methodological quality, focusing on threats to internal validity. In this module we'll consider the most frequently used research designs and we'll see how they address threats to internal validity. We'll look at experimental, quasi-experimental and correlational designs, as well as some other designs you should be familiar with. To understand and appreciate these designs we will discuss some general concepts such as randomization and matching in a little more detail. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Measurement ~.~ Choosing a design is only the first step in the deduction phase (remember the empirical cycle?). The second step is deciding on specific ways to measure the variables of interest and disinterest. ~.~ This step is extremely important, because even if we are able to perform a true double-blind experiment, if our measurement and manipulation method are of poor quality, then internal validity will still be compromised! \\n\\nIn this module we'll look at what measurement is exactly and what the criteria for evaluating measurement are. We will also look more in-depth at self-report measures, including survey, questionnaires and tests. These methods are among the most frequently used measurement instruments in the social and behavioral sciences. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Sampling ~.~ In the previous two modules we discussed research designs and methods to measure and manipulate our variables of interest and disinterest. Before a researcher can move on to the testing phase and can actually collect data, there is just one more procedure that needs to be decided on: Sampling. Researchers need to determine who potential participants are and how they will be selected and recruited. ~.~ Practice, Ethics & Integrity ~.~ In this last content module we will focus on the part of the research process that follows data collection. The specifics of storing data and using statistics form a course topic in their own right (see the specialization courses on Basic and Inferential Statistics). For now we will focus on more general issues to do with data, interpretation and dissemination of results that relate to ethics and integrity. Some of the concepts that we discuss here will be familiar if you watched the interviews of the past modules. It might be interesting to (re-)watch these if you have the time! ~.~ Catch Up ~.~ In this module there's no new material to study. The only requirement in this module is that you finish up the final peer review assignment. We also advise you to take some extra time to review the material from the previous modules and to practice for the final exam. We've provided two practice exams that you can take as many times as you like. In the first one, feedback for each answer will be provided right after taking the test. We've also created some screencast videos that explain the right answers to the second practice exam in more detail. ~.~ Exam Time! ~.~ This is the final module, where you can apply everything you've learned until now in the final exam. The final exam is structured exactly like the practice exam, so you know what to expect. Please note that you can only take the final exam once a month, so make sure you are fully prepared to take the test. Please follow the honor code and do not communicate or confer with others taking this exam. Good luck! Once you've taken the exam why not check out the bonus material - a series of presentations on research integrity in the social sciences, presented at a special symposium at the University of Amsterdam in 2014.\"\n",

We will also explore limiting reagents and percent yield to address practical aspects of chemical reactions because there may be leftover reactants and/or incomplete formation of products. ~.~ Week 6 ~.~ This unit looks more in depth at molecular compounds to see how they are bonded together by looking at Lewis structures. These structures provide information about the types of bonds (single, double, or triple) as well as the connectivity of atoms. By knowing the Lewis structure, we can also predict the three-dimensional geometry of an individual molecule. ~.~ Week 7 ~.~ In this unit, we will learn about thermochemistry, which is the study of the thermal energy transfer (heat) in chemical reactions. We will learn how these measurements of heat are made via calorimetry. Then, learn to calculate heat transfer using various methods.'\n",

This module discusses ways you can extract information and manipulate data to fulfil specific business requirements. You will develop techniques for working confidently with these Excel functions and unlock the full power of Excel by manipulating and cleaning text data. This is really important because you cannot properly analyse data if it is invalid or in an unsuitable format. You will begin with the mechanics of creating a function, specifying multiple arguments, and then you will look at how to work with text in functions. You will also learn how to use multiple functions in a single formula — a technique known as nesting. The topics you will be learning this week: Functions for Combining Text; Functions for Splitting Text; Combining Text Functions; Cleaning Data & Changing Case; and Removing and replacing unwanted characters. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Working with numbers and dates ~.~ By the end of this module, you will be an expert in Excel's Date functions. This module discusses ways that you can extract information and manipulate data to fulfil specific business requirements. You will also ~.~ be looking at functions for converting data types: such as text to numbers, dates to text, and then both numbers and text to dates. You will learn to solve the problem of data not being in the correct format, and you will learn how to perform arithmetic operations with dates like you would with numbers, as well as performing calculations with dates. You will also learn some really great functions specifically for solving day-to-day tricky date problems that are required in business such as the WORKDAY, EDATE and EOMONTH functions.

You will then learn about a great Excel functionality, Named Ranges — which is another way of referencing a cell or a range of cells by giving them a sensible name. You will see that named ranges make our formulas much easier to understand and you will also see how it makes them much easier to create — using tools such as Define Name and Create from Selection. You will also learn about Excel's Name Box and the Name Manager. You will learn some exciting Excel functions that allow you to aggregate and summarise data — such as SUMIFS and COUNTIFS, and much more.

You will learn how to create, format, and manage tables, and you will learn how to easily format, select, sort, and filter in a table. You will also learn about the Total Row where you can just pick from a set of automated summarisation functions. You will learn about structured referencing — where you can continue to work with the data in a table, but the formulas look slightly different because tables use a different way to reference cells. You will also learn how to automatically extend tables whenever new data is added.

The notion of photon will then naturally emerge, as well as the weird but fundamental notion of vacuum fluctuations. ~.~ One photon state in a single mode: particle-like behaviour ~.~ In this lesson, you will discover how the quantum optics formalism leads to the particle-like behaviour of a one photon wave-packet. For this, you will have to learn the quantum optics expressions of the simple and joint photodetection signals. A comparison with the semi-classical expressions will illustrate the necessity of quantum optics. ~.~ One photon interference: Wave-Particle duality ~.~ In this lesson, you will address the fascinating question of a single photon interfering with itself, by calculating the interference pattern for a single photon launched into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In order to do it you will first learn how to treat a beam-splitter in quantum optics, a very important tool that you need to know. You will also learn that when you want to describe an optical instrument in quantum optics, it is very useful to master its classical optics description. This lesson is an opportunity to think about the mysterious concept of wave-particle duality, and about the power of the quantum formalism, which can deal consistently with two behaviours apparently contradictory . ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Multimode quantized radiation: quantum optics in a real lab ~.~ In the real world there is nothing like purely monochromatic radiation. A correct description of radiation necessarily involves several modes. In this lesson, you will learn how canonical quantization can be easily generalized to the case of several modes, and how  various observables or important quantities introduced in the single mode case are expressed in the multimode case. Beyond the formalism that you must learn to be able to read papers and books describing real situtations, you will encounter in this lesson some intriguing features of the quantum formalism: firstly, the unbelievably large size of the space of states, which is the reason for the unlimited potential power of quantum information; secondly, the question of infinities, a problem which was solved by the general procedure of renormalization. Note that optional readings are proposed as resources of some lectures. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ One photon sources in the real world ~.~ One photon sources are important components in quantum optics, both in research laboratories and in applied quantum technologies. The lesson of this week will present the various kinds of one-photon sources available today, from heralded one photon sources to one photon sources on demand. You will learn how  to use the multimode formalism presented in a previous lesson, to describe one-photon wave packets, in particular in the case of a spontaneously emitted photon. You will start with the presentation of a theoretical  tool much used in  quantum optics, the Heisenberg formalism. It will allow you to discover the formula expressing the probability of a double detection at two different times. You will also learn some `tricks of the trade' about Fourier transforms. ~.~ Wave-particle duality for a single photon in the real world ~.~ You are now ready to develop the description of a real experiment , which was the first one to reveal directly the dual nature -- wave and particle, of a real single photon wave-packet. You will not only be able to describe, with the formalism you have learned, both the particle-like and the wave-like behaviors, but you will also see how to take into account the  features of a real experiment, which is never perfect. Last and not least, we will have the opportunity to think about the notions of wave-particle duality and complementarity, which should be not confused, and about thethe statement of Feynman, who named wave-particle duality  “a great quantum mystery”. I will try to convince you that when one identifies a mysterious behavior, one should not complain, but rather explore the possibility that something new and interesting can emerge from that mystery. ~.~ One-photon based quantum technologies ~.~ In this lesson, you will discover two quantum technologies based on one photon sources. Quantum technologies allow one to achieve a goal in a way qualitatively different from a classical technology aiming at the same goal. For instance, quantum cryptography is immune to progress in computers power, while many classical cryptography methods can in principle be broken when we have more powerful computers. Similarly, quantum random number generators yield true random numbers, while classical random number generators only produce pseudo-random numbers, which might be guessed by somebody else than the user. This lesson is also an opportunity to learn two important concepts in quantum information: (i) qubits based on photon polarization; (ii) the celebrated no-cloning theorem, at the root of the security of quantum cryptography.\"\n",
      " 'Introduction to the Mission ~.~ The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body kinematics, kinetics and control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Orbits ~.~ Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated. ~.~ Reference Frame Orientation ~.~ Tasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Attitude Evaluation and Simulator ~.~ Tasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance. ~.~ Complete the Mission ~.~ Tasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet. Please note that the time it will take you to complete this module and the requisite tasks has increased from prior modules.'\n",
      " \"Introduction to Kinematics ~.~ This module covers particle kinematics. A special emphasis is placed on a frame-independent vectorial notation. The position velocity and acceleration of particles are derived using rotating frames utilizing the transport theorem. ~.~ Rigid Body Kinematics I ~.~ This module provides an overview of orientation descriptions of rigid bodies. The 3D heading is here described using either the direction cosine matrix (DCM) or the Euler angle sets.  For each set the fundamental attitude addition and subtracts are discussed, as well as the differential kinematic equation which relates coordinate rates to the body angular velocity vector. ~.~ Rigid Body Kinematics II ~.~ This module covers modern attitude coordinate sets including Euler Parameters (quaternions), principal rotation parameters, Classical Rodrigues parameters, modified Rodrigues parameters, as well as stereographic orientation parameters.  For each set the concepts of attitude addition and subtraction is developed, as well as mappings to other coordinate sets. ~.~ Static Attitude Determination ~.~ This module covers how to take an instantaneous set of observations (sun heading, magnetic field direction, star direction, etc.) and compute a corresponding 3D attitude measure.  The attitude determination methods covered include the TRIAD method, Devenport's q-method, QUEST as well as OLAE.

      " \"Introduction to Black Holes ~.~ Hello and welcome to the first module of Astro 101! In this module, you will become familiar with the basic structure of a black hole, learn the terminology used to describe them, and explore the history of black hole physics. ~.~ Life and Death of a Star ~.~ Stars are the progenitors of black holes. In this module the student will learn about the lifecycle of stars, how stars produce energy, and how they radiate away energy. We will explore the death of stars, and what is produced by the death of stars, on all scales ; from the building blocks of life (carbon) to black holes. ~.~ The Structure of Spacetime ~.~ What happens if you travel close to the speed of light? What happens to the passage of time as you fall towards a black hole? This module will explore relativity. We look at the many ways black holes affect the universe around them from discussions of reference frames through to the change in the passage of time as you approach a black hole. ~.~ Sizing Up Black Holes ~.~ So far discussion has focussed on either the general case for black holes, of the stellar mass variety (endpoint of a star's life). In this module students will explore the various sizes of black holes and their measurable properties. Students will learn that there are four major types of astrophysical black holes (primordial/mini black hole’s, stellar mass, intermediate mass and supermassive black holes),  and discover current theories on their formation, and what might feed them. Students will also gain an knowledge of ‘no-hair’ theorem and gravitational lensing. We will also explore the formation of supermassive black holes, intermediate mass black holes, and mini black holes in particle accelerators. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Approaching a Black Hole ~.~ What would you see as you approached a black hole, using a black hole binary as a vehicle to explore black holes? In this module students will follow material as it is transferred from a companion star to a black hole via Roche lobe overflow or wind fed accretion. They will then follow that material down through the accretion disc to explore tidal forces to learn about the ways in which black holes can rip apart surrounding material. This material will then pass through the innermost stable orbit of the disc, before falling in. Students will also get the opportunity to look at jets - the outflow of material from the innermost regions of this structure. ~.~ Module Objective: Introduce properties of black holes from the outside in, through the context of a journey into the event horizon of a black hole. What would we see as we are far away? What will we see and experience as we get closer? What is a disc? What is a jet? ~.~ Crossing the Event Horizon ~.~ Module Description: What would happen if you fell into a black hole? In this module students continue on their journey through a black hole binary system, from the innermost stable orbit of the accretion disc to the singularity itself. Students will learn about the structure of a basic black hole, as well as rotating black holes. Students will explore the concept of wormholes and singularities.                          Module Objectives: Students will learn about the innermost region around a black hole, about its lack of surface and about the presence and definition of an event horizon. Students will also explore the impact that spin can have on this region, and how it is measured. Finally they will look inside the event horizon to discover the basic concepts of singularities and wormholes. ~.~ Inside a Black Hole ~.~ What is in a black hole? This module will start to explore the theoretical side of black hole physics.  You will receive a basic introduction to relevant topics of Quantum Mechanics and thermodynamics with the aim of understanding current black hole debates among the giants of the field. ~.~ Hunting for Black Holes ~.~ If black holes absorb all light, how do we see them? In this module, you will explore how astronomers observe real black holes, from studies of accretion discs and jets to the study of material orbiting a black hole. ~.~ Our Eyes in the Skies ~.~ Black holes change over time. This module will focus on how and why black holes change as well as how we look for these changes. ~.~ Riding the Gravity Wave ~.~ How do you study a black hole that has no visible companion? In this module the student will be introduced to gravitational radiation. With the 2016 LIGO discovery of gravitational waves, a whole new branch of astronomy has been opened.\"\n",
      " 'Planets in the Solar System and Beyond ~.~ Students will learn about planet formation by examining our own solar system and how these basic principles apply to exoplanets (planets around other stars). ~.~ Hunting for Exoplanets ~.~ Students will learn about how astronomers look for planets around other stars, why it is so difficult to find them, and what we can learn about the properties of planets from each detection method. ~.~ Habitability ~.~ Students will learn about the features of stars and exoplanets that might promote the development of life outside of Earth. ~.~ Life ~.~ Students will learn about the biological history of Earth, how life can develop and thrive in extreme conditions, and where else in the universe life might exist. ~.~ Emerging Complex Life and Intelligence ~.~ Students will learn about the development of complex organisms on Earth and the biological processes that led to species evolving intelligence. ~.~ SETI and Cosmic Companionship ~.~ Students will learn about the possibilities of finding intelligence species on other planets, and the challenges of interplanetary and interspecies communication and exploration.'\n",

The lectures and \"wiki\" material address these themes: light, image formation, and DS9. Dive right in! ~.~ Basic Astronomical Data and a DS9 Smorgasbord ~.~ Welcome to week two of \"Analyzing the Universe\". This week we will be exploring some of the means we have at our disposal to find out many things about the stars. It is really quite incredible that these tiny pinpoints of light can yield so much information about their nature and about the structure of the Universe as a whole.   And if this is your first visit to the course, welcome and jump right in! ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Stellar Evolution and White Dwarfs ~.~ This week is our first in-depth look at an x-ray source, and it involves a white dwarf in a binary system. So sharpen up your detective skills, keep your copy of DS9 at the ready, and let\\'s get down to business. It should be an exciting week. ~.~ Orbits, Gravity, and Clocks in the Sky ~.~ This week we turn our attention to another fascinating cosmic source, discovered in the infancy of x-ray astronomy: Cen X-3. In so doing, we will see how binary stars can determine and influence many of the interesting and surprising features of our observations. ~.~ Supernovae, Our Cosmic Recycling Centers ~.~ This week, we will be examining supernovae, and their remnants. These fascinating objects are the breeding grounds for future stars, and were the sources of virtually all the atoms that make up our solar neighborhood. Every atom of calcium in every bone in your body, for example, was once shot out of a supernova, billions of years ago. ~.~ To the Ends of the Universe; Quasars, 3C273, and beyond ~.~ This week we wrap things up with trips to galaxies and exotic objects, seen long ago and far away. The mysterious quasars provide clues about the way our Universe is evolving in time. They are incredible objects (actually, come to think of it, what isn\\'t incredible in the x-ray sky?) discovered almost exactly a half century ago, quite by accident. We will explore the astonishingly prodigious x-ray output of 3C 273, one of the nearest ones, at a mere 2.5 billion light years away.'\n",
      " 'What is Life? ~.~ This lecture introduces different approaches to defining life, a necessary step if we are going to search for life. We then introduce the basic building blocks of biochemistry. One potential way of detecting life is through its byproducts like Methane. We discuss efforts to discuss life on Mars. ~.~ Planetary Atmospheres ~.~ This lecture begins by introducing the basic physics of gases, liquid and solids. The lecture then describes how the balance between gas pressure and gravity shapes the structure of planetary atmospheres. ~.~ The Moon ~.~ By studying the properties of the Moon, we learn not only about its history but about the formation history of the Earth. This lecture discusses the physics of craters and the tidal interactions between the Earth and the Moon. We then apply the physics of tides to see how it shapes the properties of planets around M stars. ~.~ Kepler and Transits ~.~ Transits have been an important event for astronomy for over 400 years. This lecture describes the transit of Venus and how it was used to measure the size of our Solar System. This lecture then discusses how NASA’s Kepler mission observes planetary transits and how its observations have shaped our understanding of the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. ~.~ Stellar Evolution ~.~ Like planets, the structure of stars are shaped by the balance between gravity and pressure. Nuclear fusion, the energy source at the star’s interior, converts Hydrogen to heavier elements. This lecture introduces these concepts and shows how nuclear burning drives the evolution of stars. ~.~ Formation of the Earth and the Origin of Water ~.~ This lecture discusses the physics of star and planet formation. Because of the conservation of angular momentum, collapsing gas clouds form disks that then fragment to eventually form planets. We observe a tremendous diversity of planetary systems which implies that planets, unlike Stars, have a much wider range of properties. ~.~ Extremophiles ~.~ Extremophiles are life forms that flourish in extreme environments—regions of very high (or low) temperatures, acidities, and even intense radioactivity. The lecture describes some of these fascinating life forms including the bacterial mats of Yellowstone and Deinococcus Radiodurans, the toughest creature on Earth. These extremophiles inform our understanding of astrobiology. ~.~ Habitable Zone, Fermi Paradox & SETI ~.~ The final lecture discusses the search for technologically advanced life in the Galaxy. We describe the “Fermi Paradox”: if technologically advanced life is common, then it would have long ago spread through the Galaxy. Thus, we might have expected to have already encountered life. This lecture ends by contemplating “why aren’t they here?”'\n",
      " 'Thinking about data ~.~ This module introduces the idea of computational thinking, and how big data can make simple problems quite challenging to solve. We use the example of calculating the median and mean stack of a set of radio astronomy images to illustrate some of the issues you encounter when working with large datasets. ~.~ Big data makes things slow ~.~ In this module we explore the idea of scaling your code. Some algorithms scale well as your dataset increases, but others become impossibly slow. We look at some of the reason for this, and use the example of cross-matching astronomical catalogues to demonstrate what kind of improvements you can make. ~.~ Querying your data ~.~ Most large astronomy projects use databases to manage their data. In this module we introduce SQL - the language most commonly used to query databases. We use SQL to query the NASA Exoplanet database and investigate the habitability of planets in other solar systems. ~.~ Managing your data ~.~ This module introduces the basic principles of setting up databases. We look at how to set up new tables, and then how to combine Python and SQL to get the best out of both approaches. We use these tools to explore the life of stars in a stellar cluster. ~.~ Learning from data: regression ~.~ This module introduces the idea of machine learning. We look at standard methodology for running machine learning experiments, and then apply this to calculating redshifts of distant galaxies using decision trees for regression. ~.~ Learning from data: classification ~.~ In this final module we explore the limitations of decision tree classifiers. We then look at ensemble classifiers, using the random forest algorithm to classify images of galaxies into different types.'\n",

In this module, in a timeline that covers billions of years, we\\'ll explore the origins of the universe, new stars & elements, and the solar system. You\\'ll have the opportunity to examine cosmology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, and geology. ~.~ The Evolutionary Epic ~.~ Travel through the evolutionary epic from the origin of life c.3.8 billion years ago, the evolution of complex forms after c.550 million years ago, to the evolution of some very odd primates - humans. Zoom in and explore evolutionary biology, geology, palaeontology, and anthropology. ~.~ Human History ~.~ After billions of years of cosmic evolution, our own rather peculiar species has emerged to cultivate even greater heights of increasing complexity. In this module, we will explore the long trend of human development from the origin of our species c.200,000 years ago to the eve of the Industrial Revolution. You will explore archaeology, paleography, and ancient, medieval, and early modern history. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Modernity ~.~ We have now arrived at one of the most dynamically changing periods ever seen in human history - our own times. This module will explore how the agrarian era that had lasted for 10,000 years transitioned to the modern era with its explosion of production and complexity. We will explore modern history, political science, and economics. ~.~ The Future ~.~ We\\'ve looked far into the deep past, now is the time to take what we\\'ve learned and look ahead.

Space exploration is entering an entrepreneurial phase that might let us venture beyond the Solar System. ~.~ Exoplanets ~.~ In the last few years, thousands of extrasolar planets have been discovered, including some that are Earth-like and possibly habitable. ~.~ Star Birth and Death ~.~ Stars are the crucibles of heavy element creation, and the chaotic regions of their birth are being understood though long wavelength observations. Gravity is the ultimate victor in the life story of any star, leaving behind the exotic end states of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. ~.~ Galaxies ~.~ The architecture of the Milky Way galaxy is that of a disk, a bulge, and a halo, with the entire assemblage bound by enigmatic dark matter. Every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole, and entire population of galaxies is sculpted by gravity into subtle structures on large scales. ~.~ Cosmology ~.~ The expanding universe points back to an extraordinary state of extremely high density and temperature called the big bang. ~.~ Life in the Universe ~.~ The Earth gives us a ringside seat on the physical, chemical, geological, and biological evolution of a dynamic terrestrial planet.
